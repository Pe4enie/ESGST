### Other Info

* All requests from `Whitelist/Blacklist Checker`, `Not Activated/Multiple Win Checker`, `Not Received Finder` and `Archive Searcher` are limited to 2 per second, to prevent a stress on the SteamGifts servers.
* If you try to leave the page while `Whitelist/Blacklist Checker`, `Not Activated/Multiple Win Checker`, `Not Received Finder` and `Archive Searcher` are running, you will get a confirmation dialog asking you if you want to leave the page. Additionally, while these features are running, their buttons are faded out.
